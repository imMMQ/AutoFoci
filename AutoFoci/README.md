# AutoFoci

This directory contains an executable [jar file for AutoFoci](AutoFoci.jar?raw=true), the java [source code](src), and a zip archive with [single cell images](Test_Images_AutoFoci.7z?raw=true) for a quick demo application. 
It also contains a [file](manual_object_rating.7z?raw=true) containing images with manually rated objects as well as an Excel sheet with the corresponding rating by three experimenters, which can be used as a starting point for experimenters without much experience in counting foci.

For instructions please follow the [PDF guide](Guidance_to_count_foci_using_AutoFoci.pdf).
