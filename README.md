# autoFoci
Automated foci counting software especially designed for high-throughput image analysis in low dose experiments.

To use autoFoci please make sure that Java 8 is installed on your operating system:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Then please download the [autoFoci.jar](autoFoci/autoFoci.jar?raw=true) file and execute it. 

The ImageJ version used within autoFoci is not compatible with Java 9, but we are working on support for it.
