# autoFoci
Automated foci counting software especially designed for high-throughput image analysis in low dose experiments.

This repository contains all files needed to perform both, the generation of single cell images as well as the subsequent counting of foci with autoFoci. 

You can download the complete repository as a zip file via [this link](archive/master.zip). 

## 1. Generation of single cell images

All files needed for this step are included in the [ImageJ](ImageJ) folder. Please follow the instructions in the PDF guide(link??). 
 

## 2. Foci counting with autoFoci

To use autoFoci please make sure that Java 8 is installed on your operating system:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Then please download the [autoFoci.jar](autoFoci/autoFoci.jar?raw=true) file and execute it. 

You can find a short guide to perform an analysis with demo data here(link??). 
For a more detailed instruction please follow the PDF guide(link??). 

The ImageJ version used within autoFoci is not compatible with Java 9, but we are working on support for it.
